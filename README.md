# (QoL improvements for) TorToiSe

This repo is for my modifications to [neonbjb/tortoise-tts](https://github.com/neonbjb/tortoise-tts). If you need the original README, refer to the original repo.

\> w-where'd everything go?

Please migrate to [mrq/ai-voice-cloning](https://git.ecker.tech/mrq/ai-voice-cloning), as that repo is the more cohesive package for voice cloning.
